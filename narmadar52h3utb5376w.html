        <h1>Narmada River</h1>


        <div class="box1">

            Narmada River, also called Narbada or Nerbudda, river in central India that has always been an important
            route between the Arabian Sea and the Ganges (Ganga) River valley. The river was called Namade by the
            2nd-century-CE Greek geographer Ptolemy.

        <div class="box2">

            The Narmada rises at an elevation of about 3,500 feet (1,080 metres) in the Maikala Range in eastern
            Madhya
            Pradesh state on the border with Chhattisgarh state. It first follows a tortuous course through the
            hills
            near Mandla and then turns northwest to pass the city of Jabalpur. There it turns southwest and then
            enters
            the structural trough between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges at Marble Rocks Gorge. Turning more
            westward,
            the river continues across Madhya Pradesh until it passes into Gujarat state. The Narmada enters the
            Gulf of
            Khambhat through an estuary 13 miles (21 km) wide, just below Bharuch.


        </div>
        <div class="box3">

            Draining the northern slopes of the Satpura Range along its 800-mile (1,300-km) course, it flows through
            the
            Hoshangabad plains, the Dhar upland, the Mahishmati plains, and the gorges at Mandhata and Murakta. The
            river has numerous waterfalls, notably the Dhuandhar Falls, southwest of Jabalpur. Its tributaries
            occasionally cause floods in the valley between the ranges.



        </div>
        <div class="box4">

            Hindus believe the Narmada River sprang from the body of the god Shiva, and in sanctity the Narmada
            ranks
            after only the Ganges. The pradaksina pilgrimage takes pilgrims from Bharuch to Amarkantak, up one bank
            of
            the river and down the other. In addition to Jabalpur, other important cities and towns on its banks
            include
            Hoshangabad, Maheshwar, Handia, and Mandhata.
