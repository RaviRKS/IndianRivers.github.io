                    The Yamuna (Hindustani: pronounced [jəmunaː]), also spelt Jumna, is the second-largest tributary
                    river of the Ganges by discharge and the longest tributary in India.
                    Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier at a height of about 4,500 m (14,800 ft)[1] on the
                    southwestern slopes of Bandarpunch peaks of the Lower Himalaya in Uttarakhand,
                    it travels a total length of 1,376 kilometres (855 mi) and has a drainage system of 366,223 square
                    kilometres (141,399 sq mi), 40.2% of the entire Ganges Basin.
                    It merges with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, which is a site of the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu
                    festival held every 12 years.

                    Like the Ganges, the Yamuna is highly venerated in Hinduism and worshipped as the goddess Yamuna.
                    In Hinduism she is the daughter of the sun god, Surya, and the sister of Yama, the god of death, and
                    so is also known as Yami.
                    According to popular legends, bathing in its sacred waters frees one from the torments of death.
                    It crosses several states: Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, passing by Uttarakhand and later Delhi, and
                    meeting its tributaries on the way,
                    including Tons, Chambal, its longest tributary which has its own large basin, followed by Sindh, the
                    Betwa, and Ken. From Uttarakhand,
                    the river flows into the state of Himachal Pradesh. After passing Paonta Sahib, Yamuna flows along
                    the boundary of Haryana
                    and Uttar Pradesh and after exiting Haryana it continues to flow till it merges with the river
                    Ganges at Sangam or Prayag in Allahbad (Uttar Pradesh).
                    It helps create the highly fertile alluvial Ganges-Yamuna Doab region between itself and the Ganges
                    in the Indo-Gangetic plain.

                    Nearly 57 million people depend on the Yamuna's waters, and the river accounts for more than 70
                    percent of Delhi's water supply.
                    It has an annual flow of 97 billion cubic metres, and nearly 4 billion cubic metres are consumed
                    every year (of which irrigation constitutes 96%).
                    At the Hathni Kund Barrage, its waters are diverted into two large canals: the Western Yamuna Canal
                    flowing towards Haryana and the Eastern Yamuna Canal towards Uttar Pradesh.
                    Beyond that point the Yamuna is joined by the Somb, a seasonal rivulet from Haryana, and by the
                    highly polluted Hindon River near Noida, by Najafgarh drain near Wazirabad
                    and by various other drains, so that it continues only as a trickling sewage-bearing drain before
                    joining the Chambal at Pachnada in the Etawah District of Uttar Pradesh.

                    The water quality in "Upper Yamuna", as 375 kilometres (233 mi) long stretch of Yamuna is called
                    from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla barrage,
                    is of "reasonably good quality" till Wazirabad barrage in Delhi. Below this, the discharge of
                    wastewater in Delhi through 15 drains between Wazirabad barrage and Okhla barrage renders the river
                    severely polluted.
                    Wazirabad barrage to Okhla Barrage, 22 km stretch of Yamuna in Delhi, is less than 2% of Yamuna's
                    total length but accounts for nearly 80% of the total pollution in the river, 22 out of 35 sewage
                    treatment plants in Delhi do not meet the wastewater standards prescribed by the Delhi Pollution
                    Control Committee (DPCC).
                    There are four main causes of Yamuna's pollution in Delhi: poor quality of water released by the
                    effluent treatment plants, household and municipal disposal sites, soil erosion resulting from
                    deforestation occurring to make way for agriculture, and resulting chemical wash-off from
                    fertilizers,
                    herbicides, pesticides and run-off from commercial activity and industrial sites.One official
                    described the river as a "sewage drain" with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values ranging from 14
                    to 28 mg/L and high coliform content.
